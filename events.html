	<div id="paddleFish"><img src="images/paddle-fish.jpg" alt="paddle and fish party"><h2>Annual TRAA Paddle and Fish</h2><p>This year we be mixed it up a bit by having the Annual TRAA Paddle & Fish on Sharon Creek Reservoir. A thunderstorm threatened but only gave us a few minutes of rain to cool us off.Fish targeted were largemouth bass, crappie and other panfish as well as some bruiser carp. Many bass were caught with some crappies mixed in to make it interesting. Paul Holmes ended up with the largest fish, a nice smallmouth bass.</p></div>
	<div id="stream2"><img src="images/stream-habitat.jpg" alt="stream habitat work 2018"><h2>Stream Habitat Work Party</h2><p>We were very excited to have a group from the MNRF's Stewardship Youth Rangers Program to do some work on Komoka Creek. This program gives groups of 16 or 17 year-olds an opportunity to spend 8 weeks working outdoors on natural resource management projects in their own community</p></div>
	<div id="hatchRoof"><img src="images/work-party.jpg" alt="hatchery roof repair"><h2>Hatchery Roof Repair</h2><p>As most members already know, a large tree was blown down during high winds on May 2nd.At the time, we thought this tree wasn't a threat as it was well up the hill and well off to one side. It unfortunately glanced off of a couple of other trees as it fell, steering it directly on to the hatchery roof!It was an incredibly hot morning but the job was finished in record time. There were materials left over for the tool shed roof as well but that will be another day!</p></div>

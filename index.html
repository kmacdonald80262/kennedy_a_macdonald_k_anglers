				<p>In the spring of 1986 the TRAA was formed by anglers concerned with the state of the fishery in the Thames River watershed, particularly the dwindling smallmouth bass population in the North Thames River.<br><br>
				The TRAA is not a fishing club, although most members are anglers and share fishing as a common interest. We are a "hands on" environmental group who likes to work at a grass roots level.</p>

				<p>The TRAA is a volunteer organization, governed by a formal constitution and by-laws. An elected Executive, with the guidence of the General Membership, sets the policies and direction for the TRAA.<br><br>
				The TRAA has a history of always having a core group of active members supported by those who just want to be part of the solution. Either way, every member of the TRAA is active in their advocacy for the health of the Thames River watershed and its inhbitants</p>

It's an ideal space with all the amenities required for us to accomplish all the "behind the scenes" work of the TRAA. Many thanks go out to the continued support of Melchers Construction Ltd</p></div>
	<div id="guill"><img src="images/guillevin.jpg" alt="guillevin logo"><p>Members of the trout hatchery rotation know the woes we've had with lighting in the hatchery. Even with larger fixtures installed a few years ago, it was still frustrating on days when the mercury dipped below -15C and the fluorescent technology just teased us with its dull flicker. Enter Mike Jeffries of Guillevin Greentech in London with nice set of bright and dependable (and new!) LED fixtures. Once they were installed it was like working in well-appointed laboratory.</p></div>
	<div id="muma"><img src="images/muma.jpg" alt="muma logo"><p>The TRAA voted unanimously to re-name the TRAA trout hatchery honouring Keith Wales' memory and his unselfish support of the TRAA's work in the London area, in particular Komoka Creek. Special thanks go out to Muma Manufacturing in St. Thomas for donating the beautiful laser-cut aluminum sign</p></div>

	<div id="angling"><img src="images/angling.jpg"><p>Before we could take the trailer to Try Recycling, we needed to get the spare tire for the trailer fixed. Pat Devincenzo, proprietor of Angling Sports, offered to get it repaired. Turns out the tire needed replacing and Pat took care of it.
	Angling Sports also supplied cards for all TRAA members that entitle them to a discount equal to the tax on anything in the store.
	Thanks Pat, your generosity is greatly appreciated.</p></div>

	<div id="newsText">
		<p>The TRAA Newsletters have evolved over the years. </p>
		<p>The first newsletters were banged out manually on a typewriter and then copied about 100 times for distribution. </p>

		<p>These initial efforts were simple (no pictures or colour!) but they did the job. </p>

		<p>The latest versions are electronic, emailed to members and other TRAA friends. They feature nice formatting, pictures and yes, colour!</p>

		<p>The greatest challenge over the years has been getting editions published on time (or at all!). Such is life within a volunteer organization like the TRAA; </p>

		<p>You have to focus your energies on where they are most effective and a newsletter falls further down that priority list. </p>
